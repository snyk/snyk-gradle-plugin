## Android build issues

Since installing Android SDK is quite a hassle, there's no automated test for the Android Build Type problem
(https://snyksec.atlassian.net/browse/BST-528).

Instead, please install Androd Studio or SDK on your own
and run `snyk test` on https://github.com/snyk-fixtures/android-cannot-auto-resolve to test
